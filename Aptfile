# Packages to install or update.
# List one app name, or link to a deb file, per line.
#
# To always download the default version, just mention the app's name.
# To download a specific version, use <app>=<version> syntax.
# Or, specify a URL to a .deb file of the version to install.

# We want a specific version of git for consistency and reliability.
# Same concept of why we specify node/npm engine versions in package.json.
# We will upgrade as needed just like we manage package.json dependencies.
# You can find all versions of git at https://launchpad.net/~git-core/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+packages?field.status_filter=published&field.series_filter=bionic
